# Automobile Trading Application
This repository contains the code for a web application facilitating automobile trade. The development followed a staged approach, with each milestone building upon the previous one.

## Development Approach:

* Milestone 1: Static Prototype
    * Created static HTML5 pages for core functionalities using HTML and CSS.
    * This stage focused on user interface (UI) design, navigation flow, and basic application structure.
* Milestone 2: Dynamic Application with MVC
    * Introduced the Express framework to build a dynamic web application.
    * Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for separation of concerns.
    * Utilized EJS templates for presentation and JavaScript for business logic.
* Milestone 3: Database Integration
    * Integrated a persistence data component (database) for storing application data.
    * Maintained the MVC structure, leveraging Express routes for data access and manipulation.
* Milestone 4: User Management
    * Implemented user authentication, authorization, and session tracking functionalities.
* Final Milestone:
    * Completed the application by incorporating all functionalities developed in previous milestones.
    * Ensured proper error handling and addressed any missing features.
